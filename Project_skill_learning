Perfect üëç You‚Äôre asking the right thing: **‚ÄúWhat exact skills do I need to learn to build this project?‚Äù**

I‚Äôll break it down for you as a **Skill Roadmap**, grouped by phases. That way, you can start small (GitHub + Drive only) and grow toward the full hybrid model (cloud + automation + VR scaling).

# üéØ Skills You Need for This Project

## üîπ Phase 1: Core Foundations (Start Now, Free Tools)

These are the **must-learn basics** to get your hybrid storage working with no cloud cost.

### 1. **Version Control & GitHub**

* Git basics: clone, push, pull, branching, merging.
* GitHub private repos (for student-specific storage).
* GitHub API (REST/GraphQL): fetching/storing JSON configs, Unity scripts, prefabs.
* Git LFS (for assets slightly bigger than 100 MB).

**Learn via:** GitHub Docs, free tutorials, Git CLI practice.

---

### 2. **Google Drive & APIs**

* Google Drive basics: file upload, permissions, folder organization.
* Google Drive API (upload files programmatically).
* Google OAuth 2.0 (secure login with Google account).
* Sharing secure links inside your LMS.

**Learn via:** Google Drive API quickstart (Python/Node.js).

---

### 3. **Unity VR Asset Management**

* Unity basics (prefabs, textures, 3D models).
* Unity Addressables system ‚Üí load assets from external URLs.
* Lightweight asset packaging ‚Üí what can go on GitHub vs cloud later.
* How to trigger asset loading from GitHub links at runtime.

**Learn via:** Unity Learn, YouTube VR dev tutorials.

---

### 4. **Backend for LMS Middleware**

* Node.js (Express.js) **or** Python (FastAPI/Flask).
* REST API basics (GET/POST, JWT tokens).
* Connecting GitHub + Google Drive APIs.
* Storing metadata + file links in MySQL/MongoDB.

**Learn via:** FreeCodeCamp, official docs, building small API projects.

## üîπ Phase 2: Scaling & Cloud (When You Have >2,000 Students)

Once your VR university grows, these become critical.

### 5. **Cloud Storage & CDN**

* AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob.
* How to upload/download assets via SDKs.
* CDN integration (CloudFront, Cloud CDN) for **low-latency VR streaming**.
* Cost management dashboards (to monitor ‚Çπ‚Çπ).

---

### 6. **DevOps & Automation**

* GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation).
* Terraform or Ansible (infra as code).
* Docker basics (containerize LMS backend).
* Kubernetes (for scaling to thousands of users).

---

### 7. **Security & Encryption**

* JWT authentication in your LMS.
* API key/token management (GitHub PATs, Google OAuth).
* Role-based access (students, teachers, admins).
* Later ‚Üí explore **Quantum Encryption** (post-quantum cryptography).

---

---

## üîπ Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Future Vision üöÄ)

This is once your system is running well.

### 8. **VR Optimization**

* Dynamic loading of assets (load only needed assets at runtime).
* Streaming VR videos from cloud/CDN.
* Unity multiplayer networking (for VR classrooms).

---

### 9. **AI/ML Enhancements**

* AI-based asset compression (smaller textures/models).
* AI-driven document search (scan PDFs, assignments).
* AI voice assistants inside VR labs.

---

### 10. **Research & Emerging Tech**

* Quantum-safe encryption for GitHub + cloud data.
* Dynamic QR codes for VR + LMS authentication.
* Blockchain-based student credential verification (certificates).

---

# üìö Suggested Learning Order

1. **Git + GitHub (2 weeks)**
2. **Google Drive API + OAuth (2‚Äì3 weeks)**
3. **Unity Addressables + external asset loading (1 month)**
4. **Node.js/Python backend for LMS + APIs (1 month)**
5. **Database (MySQL/MongoDB) (2‚Äì3 weeks)**

---

‚û°Ô∏è At this stage, you can already run **GitHub + Google Drive-only Hybrid Storage** üéâ

Then:
6\. **AWS S3/GCP Storage + CDN (1 month)**
7\. **DevOps automation + Docker (1‚Äì2 months)**
8\. **Security best practices + JWT (2 weeks)**

---

‚úÖ With this roadmap, you‚Äôll have **all the skills** to build and scale RGAC Virtual University‚Äôs storage model.
